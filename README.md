The ultimate test of multitasking â€“ drive two cars simultaneously, avoid squares, and collect circles to score big!
## Introduction

TwoDee is an  deceptively simple mobile game that tests your multitasking skills and reflexes. Inspired by the classic __Two Cars__ ,TwoDee challenges you to control not one, but two cars simultaneously. Your objective is clear: avoid colliding with squares and collect circles to score points. It's a game of coordination, timing, and precision.

### Key Features:

- _Endless Gameplay_: TwoDee offers endless gameplay, so you can keep testing your skills and aiming for new high scores.

- _Simple Controls_: Tap the left side of the screen to control the left car and the right side to control the right car. It's easy to learn but difficult to master!

TwoDee provided an exciting opportunity to combine my passion for games with my curiosity about game design.
