## Introduction

TwoDee is an  deceptively simple mobile game that tests your multitasking skills and reflexes. Inspired by the classic __Two Cars__ ,TwoDee challenges you to control not one, but two cars simultaneously. Your objective is clear: avoid colliding with squares and collect circles to score points. It's a game of coordination, timing, and precision.

### Key Features:

- _Endless Gameplay_: TwoDee offers endless gameplay, so you can keep testing your skills and aiming for new high scores.

- _Simple Controls_: Tap the left side of the screen to control the left car and the right side to control the right car. It's easy to learn but difficult to master!
